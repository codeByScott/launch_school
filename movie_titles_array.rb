# Use the dates from the previous example and store them in an array. 
# Then make your program output the same thing as exercise 3.
action_movies = 
[
  ["rambo", 1982], 
  ["terminator", 1985], 
  ["die_hard", 1989], 
  ["speed", 1994]
]

puts action_movies[0][1]
puts action_movies[1][1]
puts action_movies[2][1]
puts action_movies[3][1]

# After verifying with the solution, I realized that they really just wanted an array of the dates, but this seemed cooler.
