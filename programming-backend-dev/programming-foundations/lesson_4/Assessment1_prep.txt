Part 2: Study Guide for Interview

Once you receive a passing score on part 1, you can schedule an interview. Here are some tips on how to do well on the interview.

Areas of Focus

general programming fluency with basic Ruby
ability to speak clearly and with precision
Live Coding

We'll also ask you to code through several small programs from scratch to get a feel for how fluent you are with programming, and get a feel for your thought process. Be familiar with:

working with simple data structures like arrays and hashes
be able to manipulate arrays and hashes very fluently. For example, an exercise might be "reverse an array without using the built-in reverse method", or "select the element out of the array if its index is a fibonacci number", or "write a method to determine if a word is a palindrome, without using the reverse method", etc.
We won't have a lot of time, so come prepared to code right away. There won't be much time to warm up, so you'll have to warm up beforehand.

Communication Style

Finally, we're also assessing your ability to communicate clearly. You should speak in a clear tone and you should explain concepts with precision using the correct vocabulary. If you haven't done this before, it's likely you'll need to practice before the interview. There's a reason the previous sentence is in bold.

When you make a mistake, we're also looking for how you recover -- or whether you are able to recover at all.

Assessment Prep Videos

We did a Beginning Ruby series that will serve as great review for this test. Specifically, the sessions that are relevant to this assessment are below. The exercises you see in parts 4 and 5 will be on par with the exercises you'll see on the interview.

Part 4 - Derick does a few exercises
Part 5 - Conrad does a few exercises
Part 6 - Debugging
